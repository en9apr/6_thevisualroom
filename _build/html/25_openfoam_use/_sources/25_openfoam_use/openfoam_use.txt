Dictionaries
------------

What are dictionaries?
======================

A dictionary is an entity that contains data entries that can be retrieved by the I/O by means of keywords. The keyword entries follow the general format (keyword-value pairs)

::

    <keyword>  <dataEntry1> … <dataEntryN>; 

* Free format ASCII text files
* Parsed by OpenFOAM
* Only values actually needed are read in
* Comment lines are ``//`` or ``/* .... */`` (C format comments)
* More flexible than alternatives
* Format:
    - banner
    - FoamFile - dictionary with general information
    - e.g. transportProperties - the dictionary with the actual information
    
What is a dimensionedScalar in the transportProperties dictionary?
==================================================================

A scalar with a:

* Name
* Physical dimensions
* Value

.. code-block:: c

    nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 0.01;
    
How are the dimensions given in the transportProperties dictionary?
===================================================================

.. code-block:: c

    [M L T theta mol I Cd]
    
* M = mass (kg)
* L = length (m)
* T = time (s)
* theta = temperature (K)
* mol = quantity (mol)
* I = current (A)
* Cd = luminous intensity (candela)

OpenFOAM checks dimensions of equations


What is the turbulenceProperties dictionary?
============================================

Read by pisoFoam and simpleFoam to switch turbulence model, e.g.

.. code-block:: c

    simulationType RASModel;
    
    RAS
    {
        RASModel kEpsilon;      // chosen model
        turbulence on;          // turbulence on
        printCoeffs on;         // coefficients printed to terminal
    }

Coefficients are stored in sub-dictionaries with appopriate names.

What is the controlDict dictionary?
===================================

Controls overall behaviour of run, timestep and saving behaviour

.. code-block:: c

    startFrom startTime;        // simulation starts at t=0
    startTime 0;
    
    stopAt endTime;             // simulation ends at t=10
    endTime 10;
    
    deltaT 0.005;               // timestep = 0.005s
    
    writeControl timeStep;      // write every 100 timesteps (uncompressed ASCII format)
    writeInterval 100;

**latestTime = continue after you have started simulation for a few seconds**    
    
What is the polyMesh dictionary?
================================

Stores the mesh structure containing (from blockMeshDict):

* Boundary - list of boundary types 
* Points - list of the mesh vertices
* Faces - list of which vertices make up which faces
* Owner - list of which cells own which faces
* Neighbour - list of which face has which neighbour cell

Located in ``case/constant/polyMesh``

At start of run OpenFOAM reads this information, checks it and constructs a mesh

What is the blockMeshDict dictionary?
=====================================

* Lists boundary patches
* Used by ``$ blockMesh`` utility to generate mesh (creates polyMesh dictionary)
* Located in ``case/system``

Example - Boussineq Approximation
---------------------------------

For buoyancy-driven flow we often make use of the Boussinesq approximation : air modelled as incompressible with a body force proportional to ∆θ. Can we implement this into icoFoam?
Need to solve standard heat conduction equation:

.. math::
    {{\partial \theta} \over {\partial t}} + \nabla \cdot (u \theta) = {\kappa \over {\rho_0 C_v}} \nabla^2 \theta
    
and alter the momentum equation:

.. math::
    {{\partial u} \over {\partial t}} + \nabla \cdot(u u) = -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2 u - \beta g (\theta_0 - \theta)
 
to accommodate this.

1. Copy ``icoFoam`` solver to user directory
    * ``cd $FOAM_RUN/../applications``
    * ``cp -r $WM_PROJECT_DIR/applications/solvers/incompressible/icoFoam .``
2. Compile ``icoFoam`` in user directory
    * ``cd icoFoam/Make``
    * edit ``files`` to change ``$FOAM_APPBIN`` to ``$FOAM_USER_APPBIN``
    * ``cd ..``
    * ``wmake``
3. Understand standard icoFoam (OpenFOAM 2.4.0)

4. Modify icoFoam in the following way:
Open ``createFields.H`` and read in the various properties:

.. code-block:: c

    dimensionedScalar kappa
    (
        transportProperties.lookup ("kappa")
    );
    
(similar lines for rho0, Cv, theta0 and beta). Also worth introducing hCoeff:

.. code-block:: c

    dimensionedScalar hCoeff = kappa/( rho0 * Cv );
    
5. Introduce gravitational acceleration g; read in from the same dictionary, but is a dimensionedVector rather than a dimensionedScalar.

6. Create a temperature field theta as a volScalarField and read it in. This is very similar to the pressure field, so make a copy of this and modify accordingly.

7. Modify the momentum equation (UEqn) to add the term

.. code-block:: c

    + beta * g *( theta0 - theta )

8. Outside of the PISO loop – create and solve the temperature equation:

.. code-block:: c

    fvScalarMatrix tempEqn
    (
        fvm :: ddt (theta)
        + fvm :: div (phi, theta)
        - fvm :: laplacian (hCoeff, theta)
    );
    tempEqn.solve ();

9. Compile this using wmake (rename executable as boussinesqFoam) - folder name, icoFoam.C and files (icoFoam.C and icoFoam)


Example - Casson model
----------------------

The Casson model is a non-Newtonian viscosity model – used for chocolate, blood, etc. Can we implement in OpenFOAM? Stress-strain relation for a fluid

.. math::

    \tau = \rho \nu \dot{\gamma}

where
    
.. math::

    \dot{\gamma} = {1 \over 2}(\nabla \vec{u} + \nabla \vec{u}^T)

is rate of strain tensor

:math:`\nu` = const is a Newtonian fluid. :math:`\nu = \nu(\cdot{\gamma})` is non-Newtonian.

Casson model:

.. math::

    \nu(J_2) = {{[(\eta^2 J_2)^{1/4} + \sqrt{\tau_y / 2}]^2} \over {\rho \sqrt{J_2}}}

where

.. math::

    J_2 = ||{1 \over 2}(\nabla \vec{u} + \nabla \vec{u}^T)||^2
